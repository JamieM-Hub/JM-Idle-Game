# **ELEMENTS**
*Elements* is a simple yet alluring mobile clicker game that is best described as interactive art with a finite play time.

The project was developed by [Jamie McKenzie](https://github.com/JamieM-Hub) as part of the [Full Stack Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net) diploma at Code Institute.

# UX

*Elements* is a very primitive clicker game with no automation, no prestige system and no player abilities.
This was paramount when considering UX, as there are minimal game mechanics to keep players engaged. For this reason, major developmental focus was placed on the game's aesthetic and general immersion.

## User Stories

# Features


## If I Had Time
Given unlimited time, the following features would be in the final product:
- Unique sound effects and background music for each theme
- A progress bar alongside or instead of numerical counters

# Technologies Used
## Libraries
- Bootstrap CDN
- jQuery CDN
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts
## Languages
- HTML *49.7%*
    - A large number of small HTML elements like buttons and bootstrap grid divs have resulted in a larger than expected HTML file.

- JavaScript / jQuery *38.2%*
    - jQuery was the operational focus of this project alongside the Bootstrap grid, and many styling operations are done in jQuery instead of CSS.

-  CSS *12.1%*
    - As above, much styling was done in jQuery however all media queries have been coded in CSS.
