# **ELEMENTS**
*Elements* is a simple yet alluring mobile clicker game that is best described as interactive art with a finite play time... and achievements!

The project was developed by [Jamie McKenzie](https://github.com/JamieM-Hub) as part of the [Full Stack Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net) diploma at Code Institute.

# UX

*Elements* is a very primitive clicker game with no automation, prestige system or player abilities.
In the design process, it was significant that there are minimal game mechanics to keep players engaged. For this reason, major developmental focus was placed on the game's aesthetic and general immersion.

The aesthetic was designed to be bold and colourful in every corner, and to get more bold and colourful as the player interacts with the game and approaches the win condition.

## User Stories

- As a player looking for , I want to
- As a player
- As a player

# Features
- Upgrades
    - each Element can be upgraded three times, adding multipliers
- Theme change
    - 10 unlockable styling schemes, unique to each element
- Achievements
    - appears in real time when unlocked, each with a unique unlock message

## If I Had Time
Given unlimited time, the following features would be in the final product:
- Unique sound effects and background music for each theme
- A progress bar alongside or instead of numerical counters
- the option of automation

# Technologies Used
## Libraries
- Bootstrap CDN
- jQuery CDN
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts
## Languages
- HTML *49.7%*
    - A large number of small HTML elements like buttons and bootstrap grid divs have resulted in a larger than expected HTML file.

- JavaScript / jQuery *38.2%*
    - jQuery was the operational focus of this project alongside the Bootstrap grid, and many styling operations are done in jQuery instead of CSS.

-  CSS *12.1%*
    - As above, much styling was done in jQuery however all media queries have been coded in CSS.
